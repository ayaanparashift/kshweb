            Jabil wanted to set up a light engineering and assembly plant for
            manufacturing Nacelle, an aircraft component. They needed a 75,000
            square feet facility in Chakan, Pune. Jabil approached KSH INFRA for
            space in KSH Chakan Park I, considering that the park was a
            completely constructed facility.
